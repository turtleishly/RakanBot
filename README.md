Hey all, we need to collect raw data that measures metrics like reactions, messages, etc. from students to know stuff like user completion rate of modules. We also collect information like state, school, data, for other analysis. 

Currently (28/7), I've gotten it to be able to send dm polls to users to collect demographic data, which I plan on executing every time a new user onboards. It can also somewhat track reactions on every message, telling you who reacted. 

Setting up the discord bot / quick start: https://youtu.be/YD_N6Ffoojw?si=mxyD7X8bxa6anpyG 

Getting the bot to stay on permanantly, and rendering it on render: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZis54wRF98

Saving the demographic data to gsheets: https://youtu.be/sVURhxyc6jE?si=HndjlI8jJ50FnqZv

Code was mainly written by copilot. 

To access the bot, you will need the key (Token) from me (Aiden/ Kee Woo Jer). Send me your House address and I'll mail it to you. 

Just kidding, I'll probably DM it to you on WhatsApp.
